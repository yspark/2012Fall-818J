\section{Conclusion}

Android devices have security vulnerability that trojan-like applications can monitor CPU usage statistics of any applications running on users' devices. 
This side-channel attack is threatening since it does not require any permission from users and therefore it is almost impossible for users to notice this kind of side-channel attack. 
We focus on CPU usage statistics of Netflix application and propose 2 algorithms which predict the title of the movie rendered on victim's device. 
Moreover, we propose an integration of two algorithms.

As a demonstration of the feasibility of the side-channel attack, we implement a prototype side-channel application, which collect CPU usage statistics of Netflix application without any permission.
We implement two algorithms and show that our algorithms can predict the title of the movie collected through the side-channel attack at reasonable high accuracy.
Furthermore, we implement the integrated algorithm and demonstrate that it shows higher prediction accuracy with reasonable running time.
