\section{Conclusion}

Android devices have security vulnerabilities so that trojan-like applications can monitor CPU usage statistics of any applications running on a user's device. 
This side-channel attack is threatening since it does not require any permission from a user and, therefore, it is almost impossible for a user to notice this kind of side-channel attack. 
We focus on CPU usage statistics of the Netflix application and propose 2 algorithms that predict the title of the movie rendered on a victim's device. 
Moreover, we propose an integration of the two algorithms.

As a demonstration of the feasibility of the side-channel attack, we implement a prototype side-channel application, which collects CPU usage statistics of the Netflix application without any permission.
We implement the two algorithms and show that our algorithms can predict the title of the movie collected through the side-channel attack at reasonably high accuracy.
Furthermore, we implement the integrated algorithm and demonstrate that it shows higher prediction accuracy with reasonable execution time.
