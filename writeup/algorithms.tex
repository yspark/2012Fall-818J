\section{CPU Pattern Matching Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithms}

We present two pattern matching algorithms that achieve the goal of the project independently.
We first present Fast Subsequence Matching algorithm which preprocesses raw sequences of CPU usage statistics and then converts raw sequences into 


Though our ultimate goal is to merge two separate algorithms into one integrated solution in order to maximize accuracy and efficiency, we first develop the two algorithm separately to check the feasibility of the algorithms.
