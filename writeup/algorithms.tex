\section{CPU Pattern Matching Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithms}

We are parallely developing two  pattern (or sequence) matching algorithms that achieve the goal of the project independently. Though our ultimate goal is to merge two separate algorithms into one integrated solution in order to maximize accuracy and efficiency, we first develop the two algorithm separately to check the feasibility of the algorithms.
