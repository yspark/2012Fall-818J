\section{Deliverables}
\label{sec:deliverables}
We expect two types of deliverables: an Application and Demo\\
An application: \\
We will implement an Android application.
It will run background and monitor CPU usage of specific process (netflix).
CPU usage statics will be logged.
If the size of database is reasonable small and if the pattern matching algorithm takes reasonable amount of time, 
the application will perform pattern matching and output which movie the user is watching. 

Demo scenario: \\
\indent 1) The adversary application will be launched as a background process in an Adroid-platform mobile device\\
\indent 2) The victim application will render a movie randomly chosen from the database we pre-built. \\
\indent 3) The adversary application will monitor CPU usage statistics of the victrim application\\
\indent 4) The adversary application will match a query patterns to our reference database, and run matching algorithm to find out the title of the movie.\\
