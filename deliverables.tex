\section{Deliverables}
\label{sec:deliverables}
We expect two types of deliverables: an Application and Demo\\
An application: \\
We will implement an Android application.
Demo scenario: \\
\indent 1) The adversary application will be launched as a background process in an Adroid-platform mobile device\\
\indent 2) The victim application will render a movie randomly chosen from the database we pre-built. \\
\indent 3) The adversary application will monitor CPU usage statistics of the victim application\\
\indent 4) The adversary application will match a query patterns to our reference database, and run matching algorithm to find out the title of the movie.\\
